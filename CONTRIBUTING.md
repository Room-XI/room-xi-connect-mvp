# Contributing to Room XI Connect

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Room XI Connect! This project is dedicated to supporting youth mental health through technology, and we welcome contributions that align with our mission of creating safe, accessible, and trauma-informed digital spaces.

## Our Mission

Room XI Connect is designed to provide a safe, supportive digital environment for young people to track their mental health, discover community programs, and access crisis support when needed. Every contribution should prioritize user safety, privacy, and emotional wellbeing.

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. Please treat all community members with respect and kindness. Harassment, discrimination, or inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated.

## Getting Started

Before contributing, please familiarize yourself with the project structure and our trauma-informed design principles. The application uses React with TypeScript, Supabase for the backend, and follows accessibility best practices.

### Development Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies using npm. Copy the environment example file and configure your Supabase credentials. The README.md file contains detailed setup instructions for local development.

### Understanding Our Design System

Room XI Connect uses the "Cosmic Garden" design system, which emphasizes calm, tranquil aesthetics with cosmic elements. The color palette avoids harsh or alarming colors, particularly red tones that might trigger anxiety. All animations are gentle and respect user preferences for reduced motion.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Trauma-Informed Development

All contributions must adhere to trauma-informed design principles. This means prioritizing user safety, avoiding potentially triggering elements, maintaining user agency and choice, and ensuring emotional safety throughout the user experience. Features should be inclusive and accessible to users with diverse needs and experiences.

### Security and Privacy

Given the sensitive nature of mental health data, security and privacy are paramount. All code must follow secure coding practices, properly handle sensitive information, maintain GDPR and PHIPA compliance, and undergo security review before merging. Never commit sensitive data or credentials to the repository.

### Accessibility Requirements

Room XI Connect aims to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. All contributions should include proper semantic HTML, keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, sufficient color contrast, and alternative text for images. Test your changes with accessibility tools and screen readers when possible.

### Code Quality Standards

We maintain high code quality through TypeScript for type safety, comprehensive testing for new features, clear documentation and comments, consistent code formatting, and meaningful commit messages. Follow the existing code style and patterns used throughout the project.

## Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions including bug fixes, new features that benefit youth mental health, documentation improvements, accessibility enhancements, security improvements, and performance optimizations. Before starting work on major features, please open an issue to discuss your proposal with the maintainers.

## Submission Process

Fork the repository and create a feature branch from main. Make your changes following our guidelines and test thoroughly on multiple devices and browsers. Write or update tests as needed and ensure all existing tests pass. Update documentation if your changes affect user-facing features or APIs.

When submitting your pull request, use our pull request template and provide a clear description of your changes. Include screenshots for UI changes and explain how your contribution benefits youth users. Be prepared to address feedback and make revisions as needed.

## Review Process

All pull requests undergo review for code quality, security implications, accessibility compliance, trauma-informed design adherence, and overall impact on user experience. Reviews may take several days, and we appreciate your patience as we ensure all contributions meet our high standards.

## Getting Help

If you need assistance, feel free to open an issue for questions or clarification, join our community discussions, or reach out to maintainers directly for sensitive topics. We're here to help you contribute successfully to this important project.

## Recognition

We value all contributions to Room XI Connect. Contributors will be recognized in our documentation and release notes. For significant contributions, we may invite you to join our contributor community for ongoing collaboration and input on project direction.

## Special Considerations

### Crisis Support Features

Changes to crisis support functionality require extra careful review. These features are critical for user safety and must be thoroughly tested. If you're working on crisis-related features, please coordinate closely with maintainers and consider consulting with mental health professionals.

### Data Handling

Any changes that affect how user data is collected, stored, or processed must undergo additional privacy review. We take data protection seriously and must ensure all changes maintain our compliance with privacy regulations.

### Youth-Centric Design

Remember that our primary users are young people who may be experiencing mental health challenges. All design and functionality decisions should consider the unique needs, preferences, and vulnerabilities of this population.

Thank you for contributing to Room XI Connect and helping us create a safer, more supportive digital world for young people. Your efforts make a real difference in the lives of youth seeking mental health support and community connection.
