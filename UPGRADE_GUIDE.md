## Migration Guide

### 1. Database Migration

Run the migration script to add new tables and update existing ones:

```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or manually run the migration
psql -h YOUR_DB_HOST -U postgres -d postgres -f supabase/migrations/20241018_edmonton_expansion.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Add the following new environment variables:

```bash
# SendGrid (for guardian consent emails)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_api_key
SENDGRID_FROM=consent@roomxiconnect.org

# Upstash Redis (for rate limiting)
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-db.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_token

# App URL (for consent verification links)
APP_URL=https://roomxiconnect.org

# Encryption (store in Supabase Vault)
app.case_notes_encryption_key=your_256_bit_key
app.xid_pepper=your_random_pepper
```

Generate encryption keys:

```bash
# Case notes encryption key (256-bit)
openssl rand -base64 32

# XID pepper (512-bit)
openssl rand -hex 64
```

Store in Supabase secrets:

```bash
supabase secrets set app.case_notes_encryption_key="YOUR_KEY"
supabase secrets set app.xid_pepper="YOUR_PEPPER"
```

### 3. Deploy Edge Functions

Deploy the new and updated Edge Functions:

```bash
supabase functions deploy referral-create
supabase functions deploy send-consent-email
supabase functions deploy verify-consent
supabase functions deploy xid-create
```

### 4. Seed Initial Data

Insert Room XI as the first organization:

```sql
INSERT INTO public.organizations (name, type, contact_email, active)
VALUES ('Room XI', 'nonprofit', 'hello@roomxi.org', true);
```

Seed coping skills (already included in migration):

```bash
# Coping skills are automatically seeded by the migration
# To add more, use the admin interface or insert directly
```

### 5. Update Frontend Dependencies

Install new dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# All dependencies are already in package.json
```

### 6. Build and Deploy

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Or deploy to your hosting provider
```

## Testing Checklist

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback:

1. **Database**: Restore from backup before migration
2. **Edge Functions**: Redeploy previous versions
3. **Frontend**: Redeploy previous build
4. **Environment Variables**: Remove new variables

```bash
# Restore database from backup
supabase db reset

# Redeploy previous Edge Functions
git checkout <previous-commit>
supabase functions deploy xid-create
```

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: SendGrid emails not sending  
**Solution**: Verify domain authentication and API key permissions

**Issue**: Case notes not decrypting  
**Solution**: Verify encryption key is set in Supabase Vault

**Issue**: RLS denying access  
**Solution**: Check user's org membership and consent status

**Issue**: Guardian consent verification failing  
**Solution**: Verify guardian email is set in youth profile

### Getting Help

- **Documentation**: See `FINAL_APP_SPEC.md` for complete specification
- **Security Issues**: See `red_flags_report.md` for known issues and fixes
- **Implementation**: See `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` for timeline

## Security Considerations

### Critical Security Fixes Included

1. ‚úÖ **Guardian consent email** - Now sends to actual guardian (was going to org)
2. ‚úÖ **Age verification** - Verifies guardian is 18+ before accepting consent
3. ‚úÖ **Case notes encryption** - AES-256 column-level encryption (was plain text)
4. ‚úÖ **Referral access control** - Time-based RLS (prevents data exposure)
5. ‚úÖ **Input validation** - Zod schemas + DB constraints (prevents XSS/injection)
6. ‚úÖ **Rate limiting** - Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
7. ‚úÖ **CSRF protection** - Token validation on all state-changing operations
8. ‚úÖ **Audit logging** - Comprehensive tracking of all data access
9. ‚úÖ **Consent withdrawal cascade** - Automatic data deletion when consent revoked
10. ‚úÖ **XID security** - Stronger hashing with salt and pepper

### Before Launch
